# HealthRiskAssessment
## Project Overview

This project analyzes a health risk dataset to identify patterns and clusters among individuals based on various health indicators. The analysis employs several machine learning techniques, including KMeans clustering, KModes clustering, and hierarchical clustering, to segment the population into distinct groups with similar health profiles. The goal is to provide insights into health risk factors and potentially inform targeted health interventions.

## Technical Details

**Libraries Used:**

*   **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
*   **numpy:** Numerical operations.
*   **matplotlib:** Data visualization.
*   **seaborn:** Enhanced data visualization.
*   **scikit-learn:** Machine learning algorithms (preprocessing, clustering, metrics).
*   **kmodes:** KModes clustering algorithm.
*   **scipy:** Hierarchical clustering and dendrogram visualization.
*   **gspread:** Google Sheets integration (for potential data output).

**Data Preprocessing:**

1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and outliers (to be implemented).
2.  **Feature Engineering:**
    *   Extracts systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the 'Blood Pressure' column.
    *   Creates a 'High\_BP' indicator variable.
    *   Converts categorical features ('Mental Health', 'Food/Nutrition', other categorical columns) to numerical representations using Label Encoding.
3.  **Scaling:** Applies standardization using StandardScaler to ensure features contribute equally to the clustering process.
4.  **Feature Selection:** Selects relevant features for clustering ('Age', 'Food/Nutrition', 'bp\_systolic', 'bp\_diastolic', 'Mental Health', 'Physical Activity', 'High\_BP').


**Clustering Algorithms:**

1.  **KMeans:**
    *   Determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
    *   Applies KMeans clustering with the chosen number of clusters.
    *   Evaluates the clustering quality using the silhouette score.
2.  **KModes:**
    *   Applies KModes for categorical data clustering.
3.  **Hierarchical Clustering:**
    *   Performs hierarchical clustering using the complete linkage method with Euclidean distance.
    *   Visualizes the clustering hierarchy using a dendrogram.
    *   Applies Agglomerative Clustering to group data into clusters.

**Visualization:**

Uses matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations such as bar plots, heatmaps, 3D scatter plots, and pie charts to illustrate data distributions, correlations, and cluster characteristics.


## Results and Output

The analysis produces cluster assignments for each individual, allowing for segmentation of the population based on health risk profiles.  Results are saved to an Excel file named 'Results\_RiskAssessment\_Clusters.xlsx'.


## Future Improvements

*   **Robust Outlier Handling:** Implement more sophisticated outlier detection and handling methods.
*   **Missing Value Imputation:** Develop strategies for handling missing values in a more statistically sound way.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform a more comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for KMeans, KModes and hierarchical clustering algorithms to optimize cluster quality.
*   **Alternative Clustering Algorithms:** Explore other clustering techniques like DBSCAN to compare results.
*   **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyze feature importance to understand the key drivers of clustering.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Use more robust metrics to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms (e.g. Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index).
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Create interactive visualizations to enhance user exploration of the data and results.
*   **Integration with Google Sheets:** Automate the process of exporting results directly to Google Sheets.
*   **Detailed Reporting:** Generate a more detailed report that summarizes the findings and provides actionable insights.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Integrate the cluster assignments into predictive models to anticipate health risks.
